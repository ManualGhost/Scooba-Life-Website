                                            With Scooba Life Diving, we took our first dive, and it was amazing! The team is very considerate, understanding, and competent. They did a great job of explaining everything, which was comforting. They can ensure that you remain composed and relaxed even while you are diving.

                                            My friends and I had a great time, and we want to thank our instructors for making it so enjoyable. We felt very at ease during the beginning training because it was done in a very professional manner. We were all extremely nervous because none of us had ever scuba dived in Abu Dhabi before, but we all emerged from the experience smiling. Thank you once more.
